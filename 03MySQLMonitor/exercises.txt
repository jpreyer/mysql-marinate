1. What do we mean when we say that MySQL has a client-server architecture?

    Clients connect to the Mysql server to read and store data.  Clients can be the MySQL monitor that ships with the MySQL server or, applications written in various languages.

2. Use the monitor help to look up information on the SELECT statement. (Weâ€™ll discuss SELECT in detail in Chapter 5.)

mysql> help SELECT;
Name: 'SELECT'
Description:
Syntax:
SELECT
    [ALL | DISTINCT | DISTINCTROW ]
      [HIGH_PRIORITY]
      [STRAIGHT_JOIN]
      [SQL_SMALL_RESULT] [SQL_BIG_RESULT] [SQL_BUFFER_RESULT]
      [SQL_CACHE | SQL_NO_CACHE] [SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS]
    select_expr [, select_expr ...]
    [FROM table_references
      [PARTITION partition_list]
    [WHERE where_condition]
    [GROUP BY {col_name | expr | position}
      [ASC | DESC], ... [WITH ROLLUP]]
    [HAVING where_condition]
    [ORDER BY {col_name | expr | position}
      [ASC | DESC], ...]
    [LIMIT {[offset,] row_count | row_count OFFSET offset}]
    [PROCEDURE procedure_name(argument_list)]
    [INTO OUTFILE 'file_name'
        [CHARACTER SET charset_name]
        export_options
      | INTO DUMPFILE 'file_name'
      | INTO var_name [, var_name]]
    [FOR UPDATE | LOCK IN SHARE MODE]]

SELECT is used to retrieve rows selected from one or more tables, and
can include UNION statements and subqueries. See [HELP UNION], and
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/subqueries.html.

The most commonly used clauses of SELECT statements are these:

o Each select_expr indicates a column that you want to retrieve. There
  must be at least one select_expr.

o table_references indicates the table or tables from which to retrieve
  rows. Its syntax is described in [HELP JOIN].

o SELECT supports explicit partition selection using the PARTITION with
  a list of partitions or subpartitions (or both) following the name of
  the table in a table_reference (see [HELP JOIN]). In this case, rows
  are selected only from the partitions listed, and any other
  partitions of the table are ignored. For more information and
  examples, see
  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/partitioning-selection.html.

  SELECT ... PARTITION from tables using storage engines such as MyISAM
  that perform table-level locks (and thus partition locks) lock only
  the partitions or subpartitions named by the PARTITION option.

  See
  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/partitioning-limitations-locki
  ng.html, for more information.

o The WHERE clause, if given, indicates the condition or conditions
  that rows must satisfy to be selected. where_condition is an
  expression that evaluates to true for each row to be selected. The
  statement selects all rows if there is no WHERE clause.

  In the WHERE expression, you can use any of the functions and
  operators that MySQL supports, except for aggregate (summary)
  functions. See
  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/expressions.html, and
  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/functions.html.

SELECT can also be used to retrieve rows computed without reference to
any table.

3. What is the difference between using the monitor in interactive mode and using
the monitor in batch mode?

    Interactive mode is a REPL (Read / Evaluate / Print / Loop), a user can use interactive mode to actively interact with MySQL and get results back.
    Using the monitor in batch mode allows you to enter statements for the monitor into a text file and have the monitor execute these statements.

4. What do the monitor user, password, and database options do?

    user: Username to use when connecting to the MySQL server via the monitor.
    password: Password to use for user used with user option.
    database: Database to use when connection via thew monitor to a MySQL server.
